===========
CapitalCoin unlike Bitcoin, uses a variable block reward (with a maximum of 1000 CPTL per block). The algorithm utilizes Moore's law which accurately predicts the growth of computational power. The creation of new coins (block reward) decreases on a scale related to the computational effort used,  with a halving every 16x the network difficulty. The more miners, the lower the block reward. If there are less miners the block reward will increase. Overall this will combine with other factors to give an inflation rate of approximately 1% which will allow for greater long term sustainability.

CAPITAL VALUE
--------
CapitalCoin is a refreshing solution to the cryptocurrency question. CapitalCoin utilizes a unique hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake design that will provide the optimum means of coin distribution and long-term support. In addition to being able to mine CapitalCoin blocks, you can accrue 10% interest annually on your held coins by leaving your wallet client open and unlocked for a minimum of 12 hours.

CAPITAL SPEED
--------
CapitalCoin utilizes a hybrid Scrypt Proof of Work/Proof of Stake coin distribution and transaction verification algorithm. This allows both dedicated PoW miners as well as CapitalCoin peers to verify transactions on the blockchain, ensuring that transactions are processed in a quick and efficient manner.

CAPITAL EQUALITY
--------
The CapitalCoin development team is confident in the successful future of the coin and will release CapitalCoin with zero blocks mined before launch. With a fair and equally distributed
